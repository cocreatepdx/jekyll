We will explore:

- Japanese stab book-binding
- Polymer clay


Join us for an exploration of polymer clay jewelry and Japanese book-binding and build something for you or your mermaid friends.

We will make / keep:

- A fairy tale coloring book (13 in. x 9 5/8 in. book of 20 perforated coloring pages) bound with
- A necklace with faux agate pendant made with colored and transluscent polymer clay and German glitter glass.

Here is a sample of some of the coloring pages for the book you will be binding (illustrated by H.J. Ford):

Turn your colorings into wall art - just remove the colored pages (already perforated) and hang them up.
