Before the Enchantress Adelina breathed her last breath, she spoke forth a simple incantation. Then, voices like a thousand winds upon broken waves told the stories of her four lifetimes. The babel solidified into images. Page by page a book took form in the air. Finally, Adelina fell into the earth and her enchanted necklace was released to bind the meaning of the images for ages to come. 

It is said that if one colors all of the pages of this book and then pulls out and wears Adelina's necklace, one will understand meaning of all images and no longer be bound by time. (Or something like that).

Join us for an exploration of polymer clay jewelry and Japanese book-binding and build something magical for you or your fairy friends.

We will make / keep:

- A fairy tale coloring book (13 in. x 9 5/8 in. book of 20 perforated coloring pages) bound with
- A necklace with faux agate pendant made with colored and transluscent polymer clay and German glitter glass.

Here is a sample of some of the coloring pages for the book you will be binding (illustrated by H.J. Ford):

Turn your colorings into wall art - just remove the colored pages (already perforated) and hang them up.

We look forward to meeting and making with you at the {{ page.title }} workshop.
