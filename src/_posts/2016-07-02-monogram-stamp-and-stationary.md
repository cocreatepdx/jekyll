Do you love the special touch of a handwritten note? Join us for an exploration of relief printing and build memorable cards and envelopes to showcase your personal writing.

You will explore:

- Transferring images
- How to use a linoleum cutter and carving techniques
- Designing Patterns
- Inking and applying rubber stamps

You will make / keep:

- One mounted monogram stamp (~ 2 1/4 in. x 2 1/4 in.) with the letter(s) of your choice.
- A few mini stamps for patterning (unmounted).
- A set of fifteen personalized stationary (cards and envelopes).
- Stamp carving tool (Speedball No.1 Lino Cutter Assortment with five cutters.)

First, you'll carve and mount your monogram stamp onto hard oak (note: not mounted in photos). Next, you'll carve mini pattern stamps (unmounted) for the interior of your envelope. Finally, you'll build your personalized set of stationary.

We recommend creating a single-initial monogram; the simplicity is elegant and you'll be able to both carve the stamp and build your stationary within the workshop time. See below regarding letter choices:

Before the Workshop <i class="checkmark box icon"></i>

 - Choose a letter you would like to carve into a stamp. <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/monogram-options.pdf"><i class="file pdf outline icon"></i>View our list of letter samples</a>. Alternatively, you may find or create your own letter. 
 - If you chose from our options above, please <a href="mailto:christopher@louiseandclark.com" target="_top">send us an email</a> with your letter selection (e.g. A1, J6, etc.). If you did not select from the document above, please bring your chosen letter to the workshop. Make sure to draw or print a letter that fits within a 2 1/4 in. x 2 1/4 in. square to properly fit your carving block and card.
